        <h3>Baobab Tree Foundation, Inc.
        Baltimore City Public Schools (BCPS) /
        Prince George’s County Public Schools (PGCPS) 
        STEM Program Pilot Proposal</h3>
        
        <p>Each one teach one</p>
        
        <p>Our goal is to touch 15,000 students and train 1,761 young people over the next three years to become STEM teachers to their peers and community, by providing access to school, after-school and weekend STEM workshops, training them to develop their own teaching methodologies and curriculums, and providing institutional support to coordinate successful local events.</p>
        
        <p>We want to awaken the natural genius of our children through exposure to the world of STEM and by incentivizing them to teach others. Along the way we aim to spark interest in further learning, instill confidence for them to successfully attend and complete iD Tech’s Advanced Laboratory for Emerging Technologies (<a href="https://www.idtech.com/academy-next">AcademyNEXT</a>) at age 16, and equip students with the contacts, skills and experience needed to start their own venture, join a business incubator or accelerator, or help assist an existing startup (or  needed to participate in the year-long Google Exchange program once they’re in college).</p>

      <h3>The Challenge</h3>
      <p>Moving a needle 5-10% doesn’t do anything if others are also moving, especially when the latter are gaining say 20% during the same period.  Underserved youth are so far behind that we must help them leapfrog ahead.  That involves a disruptive multipronged approach.    </p>
      
      <h3>Impacting 15,000 Children’s Lives in Prince George’s County Public Schools and Baltimore City Public Schools</h3>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.pgcps.org/facts-and-figures/">PGCPS</a>, African-Americans represent 76,881 students.  According to <a href="https://www.baltimorecityschools.org/about/by_the_numbers">BCPS</a>, African-Americans represent 63,990 students.  These figures do not account for the young people who have dropped out, so the population we are targeting is actually larger. In order to serve 10% of the PGCPS population though, at a 1:8 instructor to student ratio, we need at minimum 961 STEM teachers.  In BCPS, in order to serve 10% of the published school population numbers, we need 800 teachers.</p>
      <p>How are we going to seed the community with 1,761 individuals that can and will teach STEM?  By launching in five BCPS schools and Baobab’s existing network in PGCPS. </p>

      <h3>The Multipronged Approach to Moving the Needle</h3>
      <p>Our primary goal is to create an army (because an army of underrepresented teachers and evangelizers is needed) by equipping students to spread the knowledge they’ve acquired; therefore, students <u>will be required</u> to prepare an event curriculum and host an event where they teach others in the community.</p>
      <p>The big idea is to train STEM teachers and ambassadors from the populations we serve, who will then help us scale our efforts quickly.  We will do this by incentivizing them through compelling program offerings and travel opportunities, as well as free equipment and other extra positive rewards.  Taken together, these will address three areas simultaneously: the cultural component, the curriculum content component, and the confidence component.  </p>

      <h3>The cultural component</h3>
      <p>teaching the cultural history of technology and highlighting underrepresented groups contributions; inviting volunteer speakers to become role models by visiting and sharing their experiences; and, many STEM field trips.</p>

      <h3>The curriculum component</h3>
      <p>utilizing among others, Google, iD Tech and KIPR to source content, while perfecting how to execute their best practices.</p>

      <h3>The confidence component</h3>
      <p>putting it all together by requiring students to design, market and successfully host their own events (individually or in small groups).  
      This each one teach one (class) model will rear leaders and doers.
